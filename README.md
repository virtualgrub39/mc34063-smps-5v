# MC34063 DC line splitter

A very simple 12V to +-5V circuit, made using MC34063 and whatever parts I had on hand.

See notes in the schematic for more info.

#### Why even share it?

Open source hardware is not common at all, and it's quite difficult to find actual working circuits online - I'm sharing it just in case someone wants a base to create their own, much better DC converter.
